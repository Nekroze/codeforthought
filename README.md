Code for Thought
================

Code for Thought is designed to guide your first steps into programming.

This is merely the source repository. Head over to
http://code-for-thought.rtfd.org/ to view this project how it was meant to be
viewed. Also we routinely run a gambit of tests on the book and its included
code examples which can be checked at 
[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/Nekroze/codeforthought/builds).
