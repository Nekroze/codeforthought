Code for Thought
================

Code for Thought is designed to guide your first steps into programming.

This is merely the source repository. Head over to
http://code-for-thought.rtfd.org/ to view this project how it was
designed. Also we routinely run a gambit of tests on the book and its
included code examples which can be checked at
[ravis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/Nekroze/codeforthought/builds).
