RTFM!

This is where we go from programming something that works to something that is
good and useful. In the programming world the difference between the scrawlings
of a mad man and the poetry of a genius is documentation. Even if you are the
only person who uses the code you are writing and it is not to be distributed
publicly, documentation is one of the most powerful tools a programmer has at
their disposal.

If you look around programming forums and discussions enough you will find
people talking about old code that they found from years ago that has no
documentation and they have no idea what it does. At the time they wrote the
code they could figure out what it did by looking at it but nowadays it makes
little or no sense. Documentation can help us just as much as it can help
others.

When starting a new programming project often you will come across a library
that seems like it would be useful but then you try and find out how to use it
but there is little or no documentation. At this point the only option to
figure it out is to read the code and learn it like that. Some people enjoy
this but others do not, especially if you are doing a large project that uses
many different libraries. If the documentation is lacking then it doesn't
matter how brilliant, fast, clean or effective the code is.

Having documentation is a great way to get people interested in how it works
and a very handy way of reminding yourself of the direction you are going.
Documentation often helps make your code more maintainable and even makes the
code itself more readable, as often documentation is included in the source
code itself. Writing or enhancing documentation is also a great way to learn
how someone elses project works. It is also a good introduction on how to
contribute to open source projects.
