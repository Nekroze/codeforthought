Introduction
============

While **Code for Thought** is designed for those who have never programmed, it
is not exactly designed for the computer illiterate. There are some assumptions
made by this book that I should get out of the way before we get started.

Requirements
------------

First and foremost we recommend and assume a :term:`POSIX` based environment.
This means either a *Linux* operating system, like Xubuntu_(which could be
installed as a virtual machine using VirtualBox_ in any operating system) or on
windows you could install Cygwin_ (an easy way to get a :term:`POSIX` based
environment in windows for very few trade offs). All instructions in this book
are given as command line commands for a :term:`POSIX` environment. There may
be equivalents for your own setup that can be found on the internet with a
cursory google_ search.

There are many many guides on the internet on how to setup these environments,
many of which explain it all better then I could in the limited scope of this
book.

Ontop of some kind of :term:`POSIX` based environment you are going to need to
install :term:`Python` along with the packages called Setuptools_ and
:term:`Pip`. :term:`Python` will be the language we will be learning how to
code in. It is a very nice to read and concise language that is perfect for
beginners learning the basic concepts of programming. Setuptools_ and
:term:`Pip` will help us to install and distribute :term:`Python` packages.

In these environments there should be some kind of text/code editor you are
comfortable with using. Anything will do and you can change your mind and use
something else at any point. Personally I use Emacs_ which is a great editor
that has a long tradition in the programming world, although people say it has
a steep learning curve. Most programmers prefer Vim_ to Emacs_ but there are
many alternatives and if it comes down to it windows notepad will work fine...
However if you want to use notepad give NotepadPlusPlus_ a try. It is similar
to notepad but with useful programming features.

This can all be done in pure windows obviously however programming in *Linux*
is just much nicer. If you wish to program in windows only (without Cygwin_)
you will still need a text editor and be able to use the command prompt to run
your code. There may be mention of tools that are different to use or
nonexistent on windows. Most likely in these cases there are alternatives that
should not be too hard to find with a quick Google_.

Structure
---------

**Code for Thought** will take you through learning how to write your own code
from start to finish. By the end of this you will understand the major concepts
behind programming and the tools that will make your code more successful. You
will learn how to test your code and make sure it works, how to document it so
that others can help contribute to your code, and learn how to contribute to
other peoples code and make the world a better place.

OK. maybe you won't be influencing the entire world by the end of this book but
today, more than ever, the world needs people who can program. Almost everyone
you know uses computers far more then they would have 15, 10, even 5 years ago.
Yet we are all just users, so few care to even think what is behind it all.
Truth is that in general it is simpler than you think. If more people can
innovate and contribute to the growing world of computers then that has to be
making the world at least a little better, right?

This book will move slowly from concept to concept, focusing not just on
teaching you some information about programming but actually teaching you how
to teach yourself to program.

We start with an introduction to the basic concepts of programming with 
interactive examples. Then we move onto abstracting ideas into functions. Then
on to data structures. With these basics we will begin to construct simple
programs you can test out and tinker with. Then we will use example programs
and code to provide real life usage of the advanced concepts you will be
learning. As the projects we work with grow in size we will introduce new 
tools that can greatly help with programming. These include, but are not limited
to, things like; version control, unit-testing and documentation.

At the end we will have a more free form discussion (albeit rather one sided)
about programming concepts and tools for the future.

Dedication
----------

This book is dedicated to my girlfriend, Elysha. **Code for Thought** is
designed to help her and others like her to learn code and better understand
the second love of my life.
