   POSIX
      an acronym for "Portable Operating System Interface", is a family of
      standards specified by the IEEE for maintaining compatibility between
      operating systems. POSIX defines the application programming interface
      (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for
      software compatibility with variants of Unix and other operating systems.
