   POSIX
      an acronym for "Portable Operating System Interface", is a family of
      standards specified by the IEEE for maintaining compatibility between
      operating systems. POSIX defines the application programming interface
      (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for
      software compatibility with variants of Unix and other operating systems.

   Python
      A widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its
      design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows
      programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be
      possible many other common languages. The language provides constructs
      intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale

      For more information head over to http://www.python.org/ and once
      installed python can be run from the command line as such::

        $ python
      
      Or for executing a python file called, for example, ``mycode.py``::
       
        $ python mycode.py

   Pip
      A tool for installing and managing :term:`Python` packages. Simply allows
      you to install and manage any :term:`Python` packages that are available
      at https://pypi.python.org/ using the following syntax on the command
      line::

        $ pip install six

      The above command will automatically download and install the package
      called ``six``. On some systems you may need to insert the ``sudo``
      command to the begging of the pip command in order to have permissions to
      install the package.

   Interpreter
      A computer program that executes, i.e. performs, instructions written in
      a programming language. An interpreter generally uses one of the
      following strategies for program execution:
        1. parse the source code and perform its behavior directly
        2. translate source code into some efficient intermediate
           representation and immediately execute this 
        3. explicitly execute stored precompiled code[1] made by a compiler
           which is part of the interpreter system

      While generally these are used on text files containing source code many
      interpreters feature a :term:`REPL`.

   REPL
      A read–eval–print loop (:term:`REPL`) is a simple, interactive computer
      programming environment. The user enters one or more expressions (rather
      than an entire compilation unit), which are then evaluated, and the
      results displayed. These provide a simple and easy way to learn a
      language and experiment with a :term:`Snippet`.

   Snippet
      A programming term for a small region of re-usable source code, machine
      code, or text. Ordinarily, these are formally-defined operative units to
      incorporate into larger programming modules. Snippets are often used to
      clarify the meaning of an otherwise "cluttered" function, or to minimize
      the use of repeated code that is common to other functions. The snippets
      themselves may be either literal text, or written in a simple template
      language to allow substitutions, such as variable names. :term:`Snippets`
      are a  small-scale form of copy and paste programming.
