Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given. 

You too can contribute to this book. As a matter of fact almost the entire
proccess is covered in **Code for Thought** itself.

The whole book is a relatively simple to use github repository at
https://github.com/Nekroze/codeforthought where it can easily be forked,
modified and "pull requested".

If you see a problem with this book; I said something ineloquently (probably
many things), Something was hard to understand or something just doesn't work
properly (it can happen! dont look at me like that).

You can contribute in many ways:
